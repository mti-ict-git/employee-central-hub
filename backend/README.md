# Backend

This folder is reserved for the server-side codebase.

Proposed stack (confirm your preferences):

- Node.js + Express (TypeScript)
- ORM: Prisma (against Postgres/Supabase) or Sequelize
- API: REST or GraphQL
- Auth: Supabase Auth or JWT (your choice)

Next steps once preferences are confirmed:

- Initialize TypeScript project (`tsconfig.json`), linting, and scripts
- Define API routes (e.g., `/api/employees`) and validation schemas
- Configure database connection and schema migrations
- Add Docker config if needed for dev/prod parity

Please let me know your choices and I’ll scaffold the backend accordingly.
